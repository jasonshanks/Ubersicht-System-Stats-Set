# System Stats Set<br/>(a widget collection for Üebersicht)

---

## Overview
Much thanks to the excellent open-source desktop widget platform Üebersicht that Felix Hageloh has created.

I really like the presentation that Felix came up with for his widgets but I found with many of my brighter desktop pictures the text was difficult to read. I've remastering these along with Daniel Barca's CPU Meter and borrowed the background/title style of Coby Chapple's Memory Bar to create this set of the top sysmon stats I use.

I haven't included the unaltered Memory Bar but you can obtain it from the dowload link below. My positioning for it is:

    top 165px
    left 15px


## Improvements
I may add to these as I find (or learn to create) my favoured options for IP (nothing so far that shows Public/Local addresses), disk usage and others.
